# DREX Client 
DREX, or Digital Rail EXtensibility, is a program at the Museum of Making Music to simplify content management on the 16+ "digital rail" touchscreen displays. Content is created and edited using a Sanity-based CMS, then distributed to a local computer using custom middleware ("Optimus"). The DREX Client loads local files rail.json and config.json, generated by Optimus, and renders content into a predefined visual layout.
